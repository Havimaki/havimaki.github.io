      <p class="grid-paragraph">Within 5 years, I've transitioned from a <a href="https://spritzofdetail.wordpress.com" class="link-style" target="_blank">
      Fine Arts background</a> with some gallery shows 
      (<a href="https://arts.uottawa.ca/visualarts/news/university-ottawa-group-exhibition" class="link-style" target="_blank">Ottawa</a>, 
      <a href="https://artmur.com/en/exhibitions/2014-exhibitions/fresh-paint-new-construction-2014/" class="link-style" target="_blank">Montreal</a>), 
      to being a full stack (backend focussed) engineer at three successful companies (one being acquired). I have shipped code written in JavaScript 
      (React, React Native, Node.js), TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, Golang and Python. I have built infrastructure with Terraform, deployed services 
      with Jenkins, CircleCI + CodeDeploy and I've scaled infrastructure within the boundaries of a just-gone-live product. It was not an easy start, 
      but hours spent studying and taking risks by raising my hand at any new opportunity has brought me here.</p>
      
      
       
      <!-- <p class="grid-paragraph">Hi! <a href="https://spritzofdetail.wordpress.com" class="link-style" target="_blank">I have a background in 
        Fine Arts</a>, so I've done some 
        <a href="https://arts.uottawa.ca/visualarts/news/university-ottawa-group-exhibition" class="link-style" target="_blank">photography, 
          painting, sculpture</a> â€” I've even ended up in some galleries in <a href="https://studiosixtysix.ca/blogs/exhibitions/16448229-surfacing-ii"
          class="link-style" target="_blank">Ottawa</a> and <a href="https://artmur.com/en/exhibitions/2014-exhibitions/fresh-paint-new-construction-2014/"
          class="link-style" target="_blank">Montreal</a>. 
        
        But since life is usually kind of funny, I ended up becoming a full stack developer (which I LOVE). In the last 4 years, 
        I've worked on some websites as a frontend developer, helped build the CI/CD pipeline for a VPN platform and also built 
        a large portion of the backend for a cashback app. I'd love to say I'm a jack of all trades, but since my name is Danielle Havimaki, 
        i'm just going to go ahead and say, I'm a female in tech, and a woman of many interests.</p> -->
